# Forest Catchment Planner - Timeslider Component

### Introduction

The ability to visualise temporal data on a map was a critical compnoent to the [Forest Catchment Planner](https://www.forestrycatchmentplanner.nz/) Project funded by the [National Science Challenge Our Land and Water](https://ourlandandwater.nz/)

The timeslider allowed the project to visualise indicative harvest cycles over time on a map. The data the timslider consumes is approximate age class calculations of exotic forests derived.

##### Example

In the screen recording below you can see the user interacting with the timeslider by manually dragging the drag handler. This changes the data visualised on the map. The orange polygons represent indicative harvested areas.

#### Key Features

* Play the animation like a video
* Change animation speed
* Step back and forth between increments of the time slider
* Interactively drag timeslider drag handler back and forth to manually set the time you want to see.
* See time labels an increments on the timeslider bar
* Responsive design for different screen sizes. 


#### Open Source

A key aspect to the project was making data and code open source. As part of the projects intent of giving back to the community [GeoInsight](https://www.geoinsight.co.nz/) has decoupled the Timeslider component from the underyling platfrom and opened it to the community. Note: This package is Built on top of [React MapBox GL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mapbox-gl)
